# Experimental Shell-GPT Audio Command Processor

Welcome to the Experimental Shell-GPT Audio Command Processor, a cutting-edge CLI tool that combines real-time audio processing with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project serves as a thrilling glimpse into the potential future uses of LLMs, bridging the gap between verbal commands and shell execution. While undeniably fun and innovative, it treads new ground in command execution and should be used with caution.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time Audio Recording:** Utilizes the `sounddevice` library for capturing audio directly from your microphone.
- **Automatic Transcription:** Leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate and fast speech-to-text conversion.
- **Command Generation and Execution:** Uses OpenAI's language models to interpret transcriptions and execute corresponding shell commands.
- **Experimental Insight:** Provides a unique look into the potential integrations between voice commands and computer operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Please ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher before starting. Make sure to install the necessary librairies.

Instructions for use:

    Start and end the audio recording by pressing ctrl.
    Watch as your spoken commands are translated into executable shell commands.
    Exit the program safely by pressing esc.

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Disclaimer

Warning: This tool is highly experimental and can execute shell commands based on your voice inputs. This could be potentially dangerous and lead to unintended system changes or data loss. Always review the generated commands before execution and use this tool in a controlled environment. The creators of the Experimental Shell-GPT Audio Command Processor are not liable for any damages or security issues that arise from its use. Your adventure with this tool should be conducted with the utmost caution but can provide a fascinating look into the future of human-computer interaction.
